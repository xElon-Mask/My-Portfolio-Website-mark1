    "bio": "Bonsoir ! I am Elon Mask. I am a Blockchain Developer, specially in EVM Blockchains. I've started to web developing since 2020, and invest in crypto-sphere since 2019 (BTC buy at 3000$ damn... the good old time). As a Blockchain developer Junior, I have a passion for DeFi, Quant Finance and trading, and cryptocurrency. I come from a country where it is not good to be self-taught. I am everywhere, and nowhere at the same time. In order for the future to look like what we saw on movie screens, what we saw playing video games, what we read in books, we have to work. This is the sense I am looking for in my work.",
